# WMHStreamingClock
Arduino code for feeding a Warmachine streaming clock for OBS.  This consists of both a C# windows form application that handles the actual timing, and an Arduino nano that handles the display and button-events.

Initially created for the Warlords of Walsall club, you can find an example of it in use here:
